# NauMaiView

"[Nau mai](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/4356)" is MƒÅori for "Welcome".

NauMaiView is a very simple horizontally sliding, image-based SwiftUI View package.
It is designed to be a bare-bones way to add a "Welcome" experience.
NauMaiView sets out to support macOS 11 and iOS/iPadOS 14 initially.

It has a minimal feature set right now, and will likely change and evolve according to my needs.  
NauMaiView is a zero-production-dependency Swift Package.
The unit test target adds the awesome [ViewInpsector](https://github.com/nalexn/ViewInspector) to add some coverage. 

See the SwiftUI Previews for an example of how to use and code comments for details.
